# KISS Information Screen System

Simple solution to show HTML-slides on different screens and displays.

It's a small Django application, and it uses django-wysiwyg (https://github.com/pydanny/django-wysiwyg) to make nice WYSIWYG-editors.

Some may call this the start of a poor man's digital signage system.

## Installation and running

Left as an exercise to the reader.

Requirements can be found in `requirements.txt`.
